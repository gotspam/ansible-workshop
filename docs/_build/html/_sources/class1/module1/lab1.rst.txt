Deploy Web Applications
=======================

You will create a playbook to deploy applications to previously provisioned webservers.

As a reminder, the following assumes that you are using RDP to access the Jump
host provided for this lab, that you are SSH'd into the “Ansible”
host and that the current working directory in that session is ``/root/f5-ansible-workshop``.

**Examine ansible inventory file**

Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time.
It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansible’s inventory.
For this lab, the ansible inventory file is ``inventory/hosts``.

#. Edit ansible inventory file and ensure it has the entries listed below.  This lab is written for use with nano editor but you may substitute with vi or vim.

   - Type ``nano inventory/hosts`` and modify if necessary
   - Type the following into the ``inventory/hosts`` file

   .. code::

     [bigips]
     10.1.1.245

     [appservers]
     10.1.20.17 ansible_user=root
     10.1.20.20 ansible_user=root

     [webservers]
     10.1.20.15 ansible_user=root
     10.1.20.16 ansible_user=root

   - Type ``ctrl x`` then press ``enter`` to save file.

**Create Playbook to deploy web application**

#. Create a playbook ``newapp.yaml``.

   - Type ``nano playbooks/newapp.yaml``
   - Type the following into the ``playbooks/newapp.yaml`` file.


   .. code::

     ---

     - name: Deploy newapp
       hosts: webservers
       vars:
         valid_certs: no

       tasks:
         - name: deploy to server5
           copy:
             src: ../files/f5-hello-world-develop/customizations/blue.css
             dest: /var/www/server/5/css/custom.css
           tags: serv5

         - name: deploy to server6
           copy:
             src: ../files/f5-hello-world-develop/customizations/green.css
             dest: /var/www/server/6/css/custom.css
           tags: serv6

   - Type ``ctrl x`` and save file.

#. Run this playbook to copy files from ansible host to destination webservers.

   - Type ``ansible-playbook playbooks/newapp.yaml``

   If successful, you should see similar results

#. Verify results by browsing to websites.

   - Type ``curl http://10.1.20.15 --silent | grep SERVER_NAME`` and ``curl http://10.1.20.16 --silent | grep SERVER_NAME``.

   .. NOTE::

     The ``hosts: webservers`` referenced are defined in the ``inventory/hosts``
     file.  These webservers are on an internal vlan and not typically accessible by external
     users.  Upon successful deployment of the applications, app owners typically submit request for NetOps to configure app services
     such as dns, load balancing and firewall, before these applications can be accessed externally.
